This is verbatim what the email contains.

# 1 - Code Samples:
One of the attached projects is in Rust. If this code sample is not appropriate let me know. I picked it because it is quite short yet does something conceptually interesting and I have a writing sample related to it. The program converts a markdown-like language into HTML using a parser generator. It should be fairly simple to read and understand even if you do not want to run it/ have the rust toolchain on your machine. In the src folder, there is markdown.larlpop which is a context-free grammar, and main.rs which provides some basic error handling and file io. To run just do cargo run example.md example.html. This code was written as part of a group project, however, I wrote all of the code that I sent for this sample.

The other code sample in Python is for a ciphertext-only attack and cryptanalysis of a vigenere cipher. It was written earlier this year as a homework assignment for a computer security class I am taking. To demo the program you can just run it with ciphertext.txt in the working directory. See the program and its associated comments. If of interest, in that folder, I also attached the written part of that homework which further explained my rationale.

If the rust sample is problematic, let me know. I have a project I wrote in Flutter that might be of interest if pal3's front is in a reactive style UI framework though as a sample it is on the larger size. 

# 2 - Writing Sample:
Paper on the rust language and the markdown parser. This was part of a group project, highlighting paragraphs I wrote.

If you want a solo writing example I also placed an essay I wrote on generative AI and whether content creators should be compensated for its use.

# 3 - Contact for other USC Programs:

I've received no other contact.
